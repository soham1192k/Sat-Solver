We have used c++17 for this assignment

How to run:
1. Ensure that "input.txt","output.txt","satsolver.cpp" and "compute.cpp" are present in the same folder.
2. Paste the input in "input.txt" (no need to remove comments)
3. Run "make"
4. The output should be there in "output.txt"
5. compute.cpp tells us if the assignment which has been spit out, satisfies the formula.
6. To clean the binary, run "make clean".
